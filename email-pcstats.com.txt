Dear Sir or Madam,

I am a student at the University of Castilla - La Mancha in Spain. I am planning to do an study about automated processes of motherboards.

I have found your article "How Motherboards Are Made: A Gigabyte Factory Tour" [1] in Google and I am really interested in using it in my study, but I feel the need to ask you for your permission to use that material.

The use of your material would be pure personal and for non-commercial use, just educational purposes.

Looking forward to hearing from you.


Yours faithfully,
Jose Domingo López López
